# Syncr ðŸ”„

Syncr is a tiny utility used to sync code workspaces for students writing code in class. It monitors a directory on the computer for changes; if changes are made, Syncr automatically makes a copy of the file to another directory, usually one that's mounted on a USB.

The tool is written in Go. 

## Installation

Download the compiled `syncr.exe` file from [releases](https://github.com/itsmingjie/syncr/releases).

## Usage

1. Double-click on the downloaded executable
1. Drag the source/target folders into the popup window, and press [Enter] to confirm
1. Enjoy!

To terminate Syncr, simply press [CTRL] + [C].
